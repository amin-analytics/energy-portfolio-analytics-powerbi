# Energy Portfolio Analytics – Capital Allocation & Risk Insights (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project presents an executive-level energy portfolio analytics dashboard built in Power BI, designed to support capital allocation, risk assessment, and performance optimization across renewable energy investments.

The report simulates a real-world energy investment portfolio covering wind and solar projects across multiple regions, focusing on capacity, CAPEX exposure, IRR, and risk-adjusted performance.

## Business Objectives
•	Monitor total portfolio capacity and capital exposure
•	Evaluate development pipeline vs operational assets
•	Assess risk concentration across regions and technologies
•	Support investment prioritization using risk-adjusted metrics

## Key Metrics
•	Total Portfolio Capacity (MW)
•	Development Pipeline Capacity (MW)
•	Total CAPEX Exposure (USD m)
•	Weighted Average IRR (%)
•	High-Risk Capacity Share (%)
•	High-Risk CAPEX Share (%)


## Pages Included
### 1. Executive Energy Portfolio Overview
•	Portfolio-wide KPIs for capacity, CAPEX, and IRR
•	Capacity and CAPEX breakdown by region and technology
•	Project status analysis (Pipeline, Committed, Operational)
•	Interactive slicers for region, technology, and project status

### 2. Risk & Investment Exposure Analysis
•	Development pipeline capacity by risk level
•	CAPEX exposure split by risk category
•	Risk-adjusted IRR analysis
•	Identification of high-risk concentration areas

### 3. Performance Drivers – Region & Technology
•	Heatmap showing IRR performance by region and technology
•	Decomposition tree for capacity and IRR drivers
•	Waterfall chart illustrating CAPEX contribution by region
•	Context-aware KPIs responding to selected filters

## Business Questions Answered
•	Where is capital most exposed to high-risk projects?
•	Which regions and technologies drive portfolio returns?
•	How balanced is the development pipeline across risk levels?
•	Which investment areas offer the best risk-adjusted returns?

## Data Modeling & DAX
•	Star schema with fact and dimension tables
•	Dedicated Date, Region, Technology, Risk, and Status dimensions
•	Measures for:
        o	Weighted Average IRR
        o	Development Pipeline Capacity
        o	Risk-based CAPEX and capacity shares
        o	Context-aware KPIs using CALCULATE and FILTER
•	Clean one-to-many relationships following BI best practices

## Tools & Skills Demonstrated
•	Power BI
•	DAX (CALCULATE, FILTER, DIVIDE, context handling)
•	Data modeling (investment-grade star schema)
•	Executive dashboard design
•	Energy & infrastructure analytics
